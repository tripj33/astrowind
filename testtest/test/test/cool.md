{"Idea":"Significant impairment of sleep, appetite, libido, or daily functioning defines depressive sadness as pathologic and requiring clinical intervention.","Question":"A 32-year-old female presents with persistent low mood, anhedonia, and fatigue for the past three months. She reports difficulty concentrating, significant weight loss due to decreased appetite, and insomnia. She denies suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?","Option_1":"Prescription of St. John's Wort and referral to a support group.","Option_2":"Initiation of psychotherapy and psychoeducation about depressive disorders.","Option_3":"Start an antidepressant such as sertraline (Zoloft) and schedule a follow-up appointment in 4-6 weeks.","Option_4":"Recommend lifestyle changes such as improved sleep hygiene and increased exercise.","Answer":"Initiation of psychotherapy and psychoeducation about depressive disorders.","Rationale":"While each option could be a component of treatment, the *most* appropraite *initial* intervention for a patient presenting with depression involves psychotherapy and psychoeducation. Antidepressants may be necessary but are not necessarily the first step. Addressing the patient's understanding of the disorder and providing coping strategies through therapy are crucial. St. John's Wort has variable efficacy and potential drug interactions. Lifestyle changes are beneficial but likely insufficient as a sole intervention."}
