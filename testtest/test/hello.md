{"Idea":"Cognitive models state that depression is perpetuated by automatic negative beliefs about oneself, the future, and the external world.","Question":"A 35-year-old patient with major depressive disorder has been in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for 8 weeks. While the patient acknowledges the irrationality of negative thoughts, they report difficulty challenging them and a persistent belief in their validity despite evidence to the contrary. Which of the following CBT techniques would be MOST appropriate to implement NEXT?","Option_1":"Socratic questioning to explore the origins of the negative thoughts.","Option_2":"Behavioral activation to increase engagement in pleasurable activities.","Option_3":"Cognitive restructuring to directly challenge and replace the negative thoughts.","Option_4":"Mindfulness exercises to promote acceptance of negative thoughts without judgment.","Answer":"Mindfulness exercises to promote acceptance of negative thoughts without judgment.","Rationale":"While cognitive restructuring, Socratic questioning, and behavioral activation are all valid CBT techniques for depression, the patient's difficulty in challenging negative thoughts suggests resistance to direct cognitive restructuring at this stage. Mindfulness helps the patient observe negative thoughts without immediate judgment or attempts to change them, fostering acceptance and potentially reducing their emotional impact. This can prepare the patient for more direct cognitive techniques later."}
